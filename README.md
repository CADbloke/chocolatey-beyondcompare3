This is the code I use to publish the BeyondCompare package to Chocolatey. 

It's actually really easy. 

 1. Follow the instructions on [chocolatey.org](http://chocolatey.org/) to setup Chocolatey
 2. Clone this repository and navigate to the folder in Powershell
 3. `cpack` to create the package
 4. `cinst beyondcompare -Source *"full-directory-path"*` to install it locally

And you're done!
